# PR Review Summary

## Overview
This PR review identified and fixed several critical issues in the Vue.js portfolio website, particularly focusing on component consistency and accessibility improvements.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. **Major Component Inconsistency** ðŸš¨
- **Issue**: `Awards.vue` (desktop) displayed academic achievements while `mAwards.vue` (mobile) displayed programming skills
- **Impact**: Confusing user experience across devices

### 2. **Accessibility Improvements** â™¿
- Added proper ARIA labels and roles
- Implemented keyboard navigation support
- Added focus management and visual focus indicators
- Included support for `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Added proper semantic HTML structure

### 3. **Performance Optimizations** âš¡
- Added reduced motion support in GSAP animations
- Improved GitHub Actions workflow with npm caching
- Used `npm ci` instead of `npm install` for faster, more reliable builds

## Code Quality Improvements

### Vue.js Best Practices âœ…
- Proper use of Composition API with `<script setup>`
- Consistent reactive data handling
- Good component separation and organization
- Proper event handling and lifecycle management

### CSS/Styling âœ…

2. Verify accessibility with screen readers
3. Test reduced motion functionality
4. Validate build process with GitHub Actions
5. Cross-browser compatibility testing

## Overall Assessment
The codebase shows good Vue.js practices and modern frontend development approaches. The critical inconsistency issue has been resolved, and the accessibility improvements make the site more inclusive. The GitHub Actions workflow is well-configured for automated deployment.
