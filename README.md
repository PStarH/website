# Personal Website

This is my personal website, built with Vue 3 and a modern frontend tech stack. The site features a modular structure, clean UI, and automated deployment.

## Tech Stack

- **Vue 3**: Modern JavaScript framework for building interactive user interfaces.
- **Vue Router**: Seamless client-side navigation and routing.
- **Vuex**: Centralized state management for better data handling.
- **Naive UI**: Beautiful, customizable Vue components.
- **JavaScript**: The core language driving all functionality.

## Automated Deployment

1. Install dependencies.
2. Build the production assets.
3. Deploy from the `dist` directory to GitHub Pages.
